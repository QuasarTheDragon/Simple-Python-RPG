# Simple-Python-RPG

Hello! Thanks for checking out my project!

Spoiler alert:
**This game isn't good, or fun.** 

I just started learning python like a day ago and wanted to start making something. I didn't even use classes or functions, it's all dumped in one file. Feel free to check out the code and use it for whatever you want :)
